    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> How did Neptune get its name?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as "the planet exterior to
            Uranus" or as "Le Verrier's planet". </li>
        <li> The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name Janus. In
            ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time,
            duality, doorways, passages, frames, and endings. </li>
        <li> Claiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name Neptune
            for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the
            French Bureau des Longitudes a French scientific institution). </li>
        <li> In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal
            support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with
            stiff resistance outside France. </li>
        <li> Struve came out in favour of the name Neptune on 29 December 1846, to
            the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.Soon, Neptune became the
            internationally accepted name.</li>
        <li> In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the
            Greek Poseidon.( in ancient Greek religion, god of the sea (and of water
            generally), earthquakes, and horses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Discovery of Neptune </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Neptune is much too faint to be viewed with the unaided eye, and it is
            slightly smaller than Uranus. Neptune is about seven times dimmer than Uranus, but if you
            have access to a dark, clear sky and carefully examine a good star map, you should have no
            trouble finding it with a good pair of binoculars.</li>
        <li> Galileo is credited as the first person to view the heavens with a telescope
            in 1609. His sketches from a few years later, the first of which was made on Dec. 28, 1612,
            suggest that he saw Neptune when it passed near Jupiter but did not recognize it as a
            planet.</li>
        <li> Neptune had been observed many times before but not recognized, and there were
            others who made various calculations about its location which did not lead to its
            observation.</li>
        <li> John Couch Adams of Britain and Urbain Jean Joseph Leverrier of France, used
            mathematics to predict that the gravity from another planet beyond Uranus was affecting the
            orbit of Uranus. They figured out not only where the planet was, but also how much mass it
            had. A young astronomer, Johann Gottfried Galle, decided to search for the predicted planet
            and observed Neptune for the first time in 1846. </li>
        <li> On September 23, 1846, Le Verrier informed Galle of his findings, and
            the same night Galle and his assistant Heinrich Louis d’Arrest identified
            Neptune at their observatory in Berlin. Noting its movement relative to
            background stars over 24 hours confirmed that it was a planet.</li>
        <li> Le Verrier quickly proposed the name Neptune for this new planet,
            though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the
            French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the
            planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the
            observatory director, François Arago.</li>
        <li> Struve came out in favour of the name Neptune on 29 December 1846, to
            the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Soon, Neptune became the
            internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the
            god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a
            mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the
            other planets, all of which, except for Earth, were named for deities
            in Greek and Roman mythology.</li>
