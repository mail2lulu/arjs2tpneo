        Exploration of Mars
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Early telescopic observations revealed colour changes on the surface that
            were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent linear features were
            ascribed to intelligent design. </li>
        <li> Further telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos and Deimos,
            polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons, the Solar
            System's tallest mountain. </li>
        <li> The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the
            red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the
            same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a far thinner
            atmosphere; it has a cold and desert-like surface. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: bisque;">Atmosphere of Mars</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Mars’ atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide (about 96
            percent), with minor amounts of other gases such as argon and nitrogen.
            The atmosphere is very thin, however, and the atmospheric pressure at
            the surface of Mars is only about 0.6 percent of Earth’s (101,000 pascals).</li>

        <li> Scientists think that Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere early in its
            history, and data from NASA spacecraft indicate that Mars has lost
            significant amounts of its atmosphere through time. The primary culprit
            for Mars’ atmospheric loss is the solar wind! </li>
        <li> Mars has surface pressures that are only around 1 % of the surface
            pressure at Earth and surface temperatures that seldom reach the melting
            point of ice and plunge dramatically at night time even in mid-latitude
            regions.</li>
        <li> Mars has surface pressures that are only around 1 % of the surface
            pressure at Earth and surface temperatures that seldom reach the melting
            point of ice and plunge dramatically at night time even in mid-latitude
            regions. </li>
        <li>Were the early wet conditions favorable for the emergence of life and
            how long could this life persisted if it did form? Microbial life on Earth
            that emerged early in its geological history occupies nearly every
            available niche that provides sufficient energy in the form of
            transportable nutrients and even Earth’s atmosphere currently bears the
            stamp of life with most of the oxygen present in the atmosphere produced
            over time by microbes. </li>
        <li> Likewise, methane in the atmosphere that can be destroyed by
            photochemistry over periods of several hundred years is constantly
            replenished by a variety of biological sources. We have not yet found
            evidence of past or present life on either Mars or on any extraterrestrial
            body for that matter. </li>
        <li> Despite the fact that Mars may once have been warm and wet, it is now a
            cold, dry, barren place. The atmosphere is thin and mainly carbondioxide.
            Ultraviolet and other forms of intense radiation bathe the surface,
            because Mars has a thin atmosphere and no active magnetic field to
            protect it. </li>
        <li> The presence of very large volcanoes at the surface indicates that Mars
            through time has been getting rid of heat.</li>
