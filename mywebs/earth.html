        Exploration of Earth
    </h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li> By the beginning of the 20th century most of the Earth's surface had been
                explored, at least superficially, except for the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Today the
                last of the unmarked areas on land maps have been filled in by radar and photographic
                mapping from aircraft and satellites.</li>
            <li> One of the last areas to be mapped was the Darin peninsula between the Panama
                Canal and Colombia. Heavy clouds, steady rain, and dense jungle vegetation made its
                exploration difficult, but airborne radar was able to penetrate the cloud cover to produce
                reliable, detailed maps of the area. </li>
            <li> In recent years data returned by Earth satellites have led to several notable
                discoveries, as, for example, drainage patterns in the Sahara, which are relics of a period
                when this region was not arid. </li>
        </ul>
